# BMIN 5030 Final Project

This repository contains my final project for BMIN 5030. The analysis examines the relationship between age, breast density, and risk of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis within one year of screening using the BCSC mammography screening dataset.

## Files
- `final_project_template_LA.qmd` — Quarto source file containing the full analysis and narrative.
- `final_project_template_LA.html` — Rendered HTML report output from the Quarto file.
- `README.md` — Brief repository description and file guide.

## How to run
Render the report locally with:
```bash
